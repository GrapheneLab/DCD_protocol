      <description>Move assignment.
Requires: that value_type, error_type and exception_type all implement move assignment.
Complexity: If the value_type for both is present, uses value_type&amp;rsquo;s move assignment operator, else either destructs or move constructs value_type as appropriate. error_type&amp;rsquo;s and exception_type&amp;rsquo;s move assignment operator are always used. Constexpr, triviality and noexcept of underlying operations is propagated.
Guarantees: If an exception is thrown during the operation, the object is left in a partially completed state, as per the normal rules for the same operation on a struct.</description>
